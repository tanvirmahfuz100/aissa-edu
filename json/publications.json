    "summary": "This study examines how GDP affects cross-country efficiency in wealth maximization using data from 106 countries (2009–2018) and a joint approach combining Stochastic Frontier Analysis (SFA) and Generalized Method of Moments (GMM). It finds that while labor and capital positively contribute to incremental net wealth, GDP has a significant negative impact on wealth maximization efficiency, reflecting diminishing marginal returns as economies grow larger. High-GDP countries tend to accumulate more wealth in absolute terms but do so less efficiently than smaller economies. The regression results further show that past efficiency improves future efficiency, whereas imports, broad money supply, and exchange rate volatility undermine wealth efficiency, while consumer price index has a positive effect. Overall, the findings suggest that GDP growth alone is not sufficient for efficient wealth creation, highlighting the need for policymakers to focus on efficiency-oriented macroeconomic management rather than growth-only strategies.",
